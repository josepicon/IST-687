#6.9 Ten Principles of Visualizations 

#1: Simplicity: create the simplest graph that conveys the information that you want to convey

#2: Encoding: consider the type of encoding object and attribute used to create a lot 

#3: Pattern v detail: focus on visualizing patterns OR on visualiing details 

#4: Ranges: select meaningful axis ranges 

#5: Transformation: data transformaions and carefully chosen aspect ratios can be used to emphasize rates of change for time-series data 

#6: Density: Plot overlapping points in a way that density difference becomes apparent 

#7: Connections: use lines when connecting sequential data in time-series plots 

#8: Aggregates: aggregate larger data sets in meaningful ways 

#9: Comparison: keep axis ranges as similar as possible (to compare variables)

#10: Colors: Select an appropriate color scheme based on the type of data
