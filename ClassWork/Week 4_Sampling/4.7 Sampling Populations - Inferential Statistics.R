#4.7 Sampling Population - Inferential Statistics 

#Inferential statistics uses random sample results to reach a conclusion about an entire population 

#Confidence Interval Estimation 

#used when the issue under investigation involves learning the value of an unknown population parament i.e.) we have no idea what the parameter is, ahead of time 

#Hypothesis Testing Procedures 

#are used when the issue under investigation involves assesing the validilty of an assumed value of a particular population parameter 

#Confidence level 

#the probability that the confidence interval accuratley estimates the population parameter (customary level used in statistics is 95%)

#Hypothesis Testing Procedures

#a random sample is collected from the population. If the resulting sample statistics are consistent with the assumed value of the population parameter, the validity of the asssumed value is confirmed. HOWEVER,If the resulting sample statistics contradict the assumed value of the population parameter, the assumed value is considered invalid 

#p-value 

#the probability that the sample statistic is at least as extreme as the resulting sample value is calcualted under the assumption that the population parameter equals the hypothesized value. This probability is reffered to as the p-value

#when the resulting p-value is 0.05 or less, it would be considered unusual to obtain these sample results by chance alone. THerefore, the more likely explanation of these sample results is that the assumed value of the population parameter is invalid
